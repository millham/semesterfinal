          <h1><b>The Sheltered Nest</b></h1>
          <br><br>
          Sheltered Nest is a 3 bedroom, 2 full bath vacation beach house that is available for rent (short-term) in Manzanita, Oregon. If you are interested, please email us at <a href="mailto:shelterednest@gmail.com">shelterednest@gmail.com</a>. It has beds for 8 (king, queen, twin with twin trundle, and double-size pull out sofa sleeper), a great room (living/dining/kitchen), a bonus room upstairs, and outdoor patios.
          <br><br>
          The house is centrally located in the heart of Manzanita, a quaint beach town with all the necessary amenities. Shops, groceries, galleries, restaurants and refreshments are 1.5 blocks away on Laneda Ave, and the beach is just 3 blocks down the street.
          <br><br>
          The dining table seats 8, and there are 4 stools at the bar. The kitchen is well stocked with knives, cookware, glassware, etc. There is cable TV and high speed Wifi. The TV in the living room has HD cable, a DVD/BR player, and USB slot for your internet stick; and the bonus room TV has a DVD/BR player, USB slot, and extra HDMI and component cables for your game console.
          <br><br>
          With exception of a wood stove for old school heat or ambiance, our house is non-smoking. The shaded back yard includes a deck off the dining room, trees nicely positioned for a hammock, a covered breezeway, and a patio with a kettle barbecue. The deck can be closed off with two gates, and the backyard includes gates and a wire fence to retain well-behaved dogs.
          <br><br>
          There is a double-size garage for your cars, bicycles, or surf/beach toys, plus it's where we keep the outdoor chairs, hammock, some kid beach toys, etc. A woodshed is the door through the rear wall of the garage.
          <br><br>
          On top of the garage is a weather station, the data and a forecast of which can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=KORTILLA18">here</a>.
